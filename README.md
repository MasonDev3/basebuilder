***************** BASE BUILDER README *****************

Thank you for checking out my game!
This is game is still currently under development at this time, 
and this README will be updated with the current version once I can reach
an 'ALPHA' state for the game.

That being said, feel free to mess around with what is here.

To start:
	- Click on 'Build Floor'
	- Add however much floor you want!
	- Create a wall by giving your spaceman a job!
		- Click on 'Build Wall'
		- Click, or click and drag to create walls!
